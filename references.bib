	abstract = {T47D_rep2 and b1913e6c1_51720e9cf were two Hi-C samples. They were born and processed at the same time, yet their fates were very different. The life of b1913e6c1_51720e9cf was simple and fruitful, while that of T47D_rep2 was full of accidents and sorrow. At the heart of these differences lies the fact that b1913e6c1_51720e9cf was born under a lab culture of Documentation, Automation, Traceability, Autonomy and compliance with the FAIR Principles. Their lives are a lesson for those who wish to embark on the journey of managing high throughput sequencing data.},
