The sequencing read belongs to an unknown portion of the genome; the task is to find its original sequence (and usually its location). Because of possible read errors, the read may not be identical to the original sequence. Most algorithms feature a seeding stage and an alignment stage. The purposes of seeding and alignment are to output a short list of candidate sequences, and to determine which is the best, respectively. Seeding is a heuristic because it does not guanrantee that the overall best sequence is in the list of candidates.\relax }}{3}}
